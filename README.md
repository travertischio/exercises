# Fizzbuzz
An exploration of programming languages

## The Goal
I plan to write [fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) in as many programming languages as possible to begin to get a sense of how they work and then possibly add some other programming exploration here as well.

## The Languages

- [x] C
- [ ] C++
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Java
- [x] Javascript
- [x] Lisp
- [ ] Pearl
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] SQL

As I finish this list I will hopefully be able to explore these languages more fully elsewhere as well as adding other languages to the list.

## Execution Notes
Description of any compiling or execution details while running these scripts.

### C
Compiled with gcc `gcc -o fizzbuzz fizzbuzz.c`
Then executed `./fuzzbuzz`

### Javascript
Run with node v6.2.2 `node fizzbuzz.js`

### Lisp
Run with clisp `clisp fizzbuzz.lisp`
