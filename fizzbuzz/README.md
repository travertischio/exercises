# Fizzbuzz
An exploration of programming languages

## The Goal
I plan to write [fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) in as many programming languages as possible to begin to get a sense of how they work and then possibly add some other programming exploration here as well.

## The Languages

- [x] C
- [ ] C++
- [x] C#
- [x] D
- [ ] Erlang
- [ ] Go
- [x] Haskell
- [x] Java
- [x] Javascript
- [x] Lisp
- [x] Perl
- [x] PHP
- [x] Python
- [x] Ruby
- [x] Rust
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] SQL

As I finish this list I will hopefully be able to explore these languages more fully elsewhere as well as adding other languages to the list.
